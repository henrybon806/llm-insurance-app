 
Learning Reflection Statement: 
Entering this course, I was unsure what environmental design truly encapsulated, but I was 
eager to analyze design choices in the real world. In Module I, the reading The Ohlone Way by 
Malcolm Margolin and lecture two on Indigenous Bay Area by Professor Castillo stood out. 
These materials challenged my preconception that the Bay Area is solely an urban region and 
highlighted the history and the profound ways culture shapes design. This was also reinforced in 
the Bauer-Wurster Hall lecture, where we explored competing viewpoints on how the 
architecture did not match the landscape. This allowed me to realize how environmental design 
is fundamentally shaped by cultural histories and contexts that extend far beyond aesthetics or 
functionality. I now view design decisions not as isolated choices but reflections of complex 
relationships between people, landscape, and their history.  
 
Keeping this in mind, while developing my Module I capstone project on Alcatraz, I highlighted 
these layered narratives by illustrating how a single location can transform through different 
periods of use and cultural significance. The history of Alcatraz is very diverse, and my 
exploration of its evolution–from federal prison to national park–deepened my understanding of 
how environmental design must acknowledge historical context and cultural power dynamics but 
also change within the context of its environment. This project challenged me to consider how 
design decisions can reinforce or protest existing power structures, a consideration I hadn't 
previously thought about.  
 
During Prof. Emeritus Chip Sullivan’s guest lecture and the transition into Module II, I learned 
specific perspective drawing and storytelling techniques. These techniques revealed how 
physically illustrating design decisions helps visualize personal landscape and environmental 
context in ways that technical drawings alone cannot capture. This perspective was reinforced 
by Jimenez Lai's "Citizens of No Place" reading, where architectural graphic novels demonstrate 
how visual storytelling can communicate complex environmental concepts and question 
standard design decision-making. During Module II, Professor Walter Hood’s guest lecture on 
hybrid landscapes stood out because it showed how graphic design can reveal layered histories 
and cultural narratives embedded in a site. These insights helped me build and design an 
aesthetic theme and story for my Module II capstone project, where I began to see graphic 
representation not just as documentation, but a tool for readers to interpret the landscape and 
its historical context. 
 
Moving forward, I will consider the new perspectives shown to me to recognize that effective 
environmental design requires cultural and historical awareness. This course has given me the 
framework to approach design decisions with greater respect for the relationship between 
people, their surroundings, and their culture. As I continue my education and beyond, I will carry 
these insights and question how my work can contribute to a more equitable and culturally 
responsive environment. (454)

From Confinement to Conservation: Alcatraz 
Alcatraz underwent a dramatic journey–from a high-security federal prison to a symbol of justice 
and ultimately a site of preservation. Once home to the most infamous criminals, Alcatraz began 
the Red Power Movement as Native American activists called for sovereignty and claimed 
ownership in 1969. Though authorities forced activists off the island in 1972, their legacy 
influenced Alcatraz’s transformation into the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. This exhibit 
highlights Alcatraz’s pivotal moments and evolution into a conservation landmark. (78 words)

Capstone Project deliverables for Module 1: Sub-section 
texts 
 
Period 1: High-security federal prison from 1934 to 1963 
The U.S. government built Alcatraz’s high-security federal prison to contain the nation’s most 
dangerous criminals, enforcing strict rules and extreme security measures. Despite these 
conditions, prisoners made numerous desperate escape attempts, all of which failed. The 
prison’s isolation made basic necessities, like transporting water, costly. These high operating 
expenses ultimately led to the prison's closure in 1963. (58 words) 
  
Period 2: Native American occupation until 1972 
After Alcatraz was abandoned, Native American activists occupied the island, igniting the Red 
Movement. Living in tents, the Native American population preserved their culture through 
music and community while demanding sovereignty through the Alcatraz Proclamation. 
However, the U.S. government forcibly removed the occupiers, citing the need to protect the 
island as a historical site. (55 words) 
  
Period 3: The Golden Gate National Recreation Area to present day 
Alcatraz shifted from a site of confinement to one of conservation. Following its controversial 
and expensive past, the U.S. government sought to write laws to designate it as a national park, 
ensuring public access and preservation. The government solidified its historical significance in 
1976 by listing it on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). (56 words)

As an Arizona resident, immersing myself in the Bay Area and its culture was unlike anything I 
had previously encountered. However, it was seeing a building on an isolated island in the 
middle of the Bay that stood out the most. As I learned more, my curiosity grew—wondering 
how a small island could have such a large impact on the surrounding area. Its evolution during 
its three primary periods—federal prison, site of Native American occupation, and National 
Park—offers a unique narrative of power and resistance. Throughout this installation, I explore 
these periods and illustrate the diversity that shaped Alcatraz’s identity and history.  
 
The first major time period in Alcatraz’s history was the establishment of a federal prison. This 
landmark became infamous for holding some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals. During 
this period, the first few objects on display showcase the intense security and discipline that 
prevailed. The size of the locks and the prisoner’s handbook provide a glimpse into the strict 
conditions the prisoners endured. Additionally, seeing a real cell bed offers a sense of what 
these prisoners faced throughout their time on the island. For me, however, it was the mystery 
of attempted escapes that intrigued me the most. A decoy escape head is on display to highlight 
those peculiar moments in Alcatraz’s history. Unfortunately, the piece of rusted pipe serves to 
show the high operating costs, as even fresh water was not available on the island. This artifact 
was chosen due to its significance in Alcatraz’s history, since it led to the next two periods in 
Alcatraz. 
 
The next period was the most interesting for me, as it is not noticeable at first glance. This 
period includes a real tent from the Native American occupation to highlight the true 
determination of the Red Power Movement in this time. Additionally, the Alcatraz Proclamation 
and Native American Drum express the commitment to their culture and connection to history. I 
included an example gift resource box, as I had originally questioned how it was feasible for so 
many to live on an uninhabited island with no food or water. The handmade protest sign is 
displayed to portray the never-ending conquest for Native Americans to regain their territory 
throughout the United States.  
 
After the Native Americans were pushed off the island, the United States’ government quickly 
signed laws to create the Golden Gate National Recreation Area to end the ambiguity of 
ownership of the island. This historical event is evident in the signed law and newspaper articles 
that acknowledge this significant milestone. I also included an original map and ranger badge to 
commemorate this turning  point in history as the island transitioned from disputed land to 
federally protected space. I hope these artifacts serve as a reminder of the island’s long history 
and the struggles Native Americans faced for recognition, which is not often recognized when 
discussing Alcatraz. To further emphasize the island’s importance to American history, I included 
the Statement of Significance, given to the island for numerous reasons and to reflect the true 
benefit of the National Park to the Bay Area community.(514 words)
